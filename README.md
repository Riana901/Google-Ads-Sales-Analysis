## High-Performing Segments: 'data analytics course' Keyword and Desktop Devices:
The 'data analytics course' keyword consistently shows the highest average ROI and lowest average CPA. Similarly, Desktop devices deliver the highest average ROI and lowest average CPA. These segments represent the most efficient and profitable areas of the current Google Ads strategy. Increasing investment and optimizing campaigns specifically for the 'data analytics course' keyword and Desktop users could lead to maximized returns and lower acquisition costs.
## Low-Performing Segments: 'online data analytics' Keyword and Tablet Devices:
The 'online data analytics' keyword has the lowest average ROI and highest average CPA. Tablet devices also show lower average ROI and higher average CPA compared to Desktop. These segments are less efficient and more costly for acquiring conversions. They require attention and optimization. Potential actions include: refining ad copy and targeting for the 'online data analytics' keyword, improving the mobile and tablet user experience on landing pages, adjusting bids for Tablet devices, or even considering reducing spend on these segments if optimization efforts are not fruitful.

ROI fluctuations were quite significant throughout the year. The highest ROI occurred in Month 9 (September), reaching close to 650%. A sharp decline was observed in Month 3 (March), where ROI dropped to its lowest point, around 550%. After Month 3, ROI began to gradually recover, peaking again in Month 9. ROI consistently declined during the last quarter of the year, especially in Month 12 (December).

Total clicks and conversions are relatively evenly distributed across Desktop, Mobile, and Tablet devices. While Desktop and Mobile have slightly higher proportions, this indicates that users on all device types are engaging with the ads and converting. Optimization efforts should consider the user experience and conversion funnel across all devices, even for those with higher CPAs like tablets, to ensure that potential conversions are not lost.

_📈 Business Interpretation:
Month 9 reflects the most efficient campaign performance — low cost, high return.
The declines in Month 3 and Month 12 may indicate suboptimal campaign strategies or seasonal drops in demand._
